# Multithreaded Code Runner README

This is the README for your extension "Multithreaded code-runner". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

üßµ Multithreaded Execution
Executes multiple test files in parallel using multithreading.
Significantly reduces the total runtime for large sets of testcases.
Ideal for competitive programming where time efficiency is critical.

üîó Codeforces Integration
Fetches testcases automatically from Codeforces for a given problem.
Supports both problem URLs and problem codes (e.g., 1900A, 1899C, etc.).
Eliminates the need for manual copy-pasting of input/output data.

üß™ Automated Output Matching
Runs your solution against all testcases and compares output.
Clearly highlights pass/fail status for each testcase.
Shows detailed diff if your output doesn't match the expected output.

üñ•Ô∏è Language and File Support
Supports compiled languages like C++ and interpreted scripts like Python.
Accepts standard input/output files (inputX.txt, outputX.txt) and custom formats.
Supports .exe execution for precompiled solutions.

üì¶ Clean Architecture
Modular structure with separate components for:
Testcase fetching
Multithreaded execution
Output comparison

## Requirements

To run this project locally in VS Code:

Place the code file you're working on inside the src/ directory.
(For example, the default file used is my_file.cpp.)

To enable Codeforces testcase fetching, open src/sidebar.ts and set your installed Python version (e.g., "python3.11" or "python" depending on your system setup).

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.
